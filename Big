++++++++++++++++BIG O NOTATION++++++++++++++++++++
1.
Data structures play a crucial role in computer science and programming, and their performance is often analyzed using Big O notation to understand how they scale with different input sizes. Here are some common data structures and their associated Big O notations for typical operations:

1. **Arrays**:
   - Access (by index): O(1)
   - Search (unsorted): O(n)
   - Search (sorted): O(log n) if binary search is used
   - Insertion/Deletion (at the beginning): O(n)
   - Insertion/Deletion (at the end): O(1) if amortized, O(n) in worst-case if resizing is required

2. **Linked Lists**:
   - Access (by index): O(n)
   - Search: O(n)
   - Insertion/Deletion (at the beginning): O(1)
   - Insertion/Deletion (at the end): O(n) without a tail pointer, O(1) with a tail pointer
   - Insertion/Deletion (at a specific position): O(n) if the position is not known in advance

3. **Stacks and Queues** (implemented using arrays or linked lists):
   - Push (insertion): O(1)
   - Pop (deletion): O(1)
   - Peek (access the top element): O(1)

4. **Hash Tables** (average-case complexity):
   - Insertion: O(1)
   - Deletion: O(1)
   - Search: O(1)
   - Note that these are average-case complexities; in some cases, collisions can make these operations O(n), but good hash functions and collision resolution strategies can minimize this.

5. **Binary Trees** (balanced):
   - Search/Insertion/Deletion: O(log n)
   - In the worst case, if the tree becomes unbalanced, it can degrade to O(n).

6. **Binary Search Trees (BST)**:
   - Search/Insertion/Deletion (average): O(log n)
   - In the worst case (unbalanced BST): O(n)

7. **Balanced Binary Search Trees** (e.g., AVL trees, Red-Black trees):
   - Search/Insertion/Deletion: O(log n)
   - These data structures ensure balance, so worst-case scenarios are avoided.

8. **Heaps** (Binary Min-Heap or Max-Heap):
   - Insertion: O(log n)
   - Deletion (min or max): O(log n)
   - Building a heap from an array: O(n)

9. **Graphs** (varies by representation and algorithms used):
   - Adjacency Matrix:
     - Access: O(1)
     - Insertion/Deletion: O(1)
   - Adjacency List:
     - Access: O(degree of the vertex)
     - Insertion/Deletion: O(degree of the vertex)
   - Searching and traversing graphs typically involve more complex algorithms like depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS), which can be O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices, and E is the number of edges.

It's important to note that the Big O notations
 mentioned above represent the average-case or typical
 time complexities. In practice, worst-case scenarios,
 data distribution, and the specific implementation of data
 structures can affect their actual performance. Therefore,
 it's essential to choose the appropriate data structure
 based on the specific requirements of your application and
 the expected usage patterns.
